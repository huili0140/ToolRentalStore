# Tool Rental Store

## 1 Project Overview

A tool rental store has decided to try out a new online tool rental service for its customers. My job is to develop the information management system that supports the online inventory, reservation services, and mainteinance services. 

### 1.1 Tool

The store has four types of tools available for rental: Hand Tools, Garden Tools, Ladders, and Power Tools. Hand tools include items such as wrenches, sockets, screwdrivers, hammers, etc. Garden tools include digging tools, pruning tools, trimmers, rakes, wheelbarrows, and striking tools. Ladders include straight and step. Power Tools include drills, saws, sanders, mixers,
etc.

Tools are also divided into 4 separate sub-types based on power source: 110-240 Volt A/C electric (corded), 7.2-80.0 Volt D/C
battery powered (cordless), gas-powered, and manual (no motor). Garden Tools may run on any power-source: manual, gas, electric, or cordless. All Ladders, all Hand Tools are considered manualpowered.

Tool accessories are unique to power tools and must be listed separately (e.g. drill bits, hose, gas tank, hard case, safety wear, etc). Each tool may have more than one accessory. All accessories must be paired at the time of rental and/or sale with their applicable power tool.

### 1.2 Customers

A Customer is any user interested in renting a tool. 

### 1.3 Clerk

A Clerk on duty represents the employee responsible for handling the tool inventory.
